    <h1>Course Feedback</h1>

    <h2>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h2>
    <p>Over the last few weeks, cracking open the book helped me learn a lot than just learning from the lecture. I feel like if more
        stress/reminders of reading certain parts of the book were there, it would help students learn a lot more. Also more book focused lectures would be great
        it would drive them a lot more to learn more.
    </p>

    <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
    <p>I wouldn't change anything really, just a maybe split the class into two different days with shorter classes</p>

    <h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
    <p>Yes I learned everything and more than I was expected to learn in this course.</p>

    <h2>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h2>
    <p>A lot of concepts were stuff we learned in the previous css class, I feel like this class just helped us 
        really express those and good deeper into them. One thing that's new to us though would be grids.
